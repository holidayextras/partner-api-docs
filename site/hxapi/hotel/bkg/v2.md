# Hotel Booking

[API Docs](/hxapi/) > product:[Hotels](/hxapi/hotel) > endpoint:[hotel](/hxapi/hotel/av) > request:[Make Booking (v2)](v2)

As with all bookings, this must be a POST and it must be made over HTTPS. Intermediaries will be sending credit card information, Agents will send their login details so HTTPS is required in both instances.

If you do not send the ABTANumber field then your booking will not be tracked to your agent code. For agent bookings, the Password field is also required, intermediaries do not have a password.

To retrieve all details about the booking, perform a GET request to view the booking at the location specified in `<MoreInfoURL>`. [Instructions on how to view a booking](/hxapi/viewamendcancel/view).

Currently, we can only accept up to 2 rooms per booking. If the customer needs more, you will need to make multiple requests. If an intermediary account, this would lead to multiple transactions on the credit card, and multiple charges, therefore we advise against it. Agents accounts do not suffer from this, they can make multiple requests as they process the payment themselves.

## /hotel/v2/foo

e.g. /hotel/v2/LHRSOF
