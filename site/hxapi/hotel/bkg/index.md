## Multiple rooms on same booking (UK only)

Currently, we can only accept a maximum of 2 rooms per booking. If the customer needs more, you will need to make multiple requests. If an intermediary account, you should note that this would lead to multiple transactions on the credit card, and multiple charges, and therefore we advise against it.

The additional parameters for including a second room are:

| Name        | Data Type    | Format | Mandatory? | Additional Information |
| ----        | ------------ | ------------- | -------- | ---------------------- |
| SecondRoomType        | String  | [A-Z0-9] 2 chars | N*        | This parameter is mandatory if the customer wishes to book two rooms at the same time. The room codes are as per [Room Codes](/hxapi/types/roomcode). |
| SecondRoomCode        | String        | [Room Codes](/hxapi/types/roomcode) | N                 | NB: Please note that the room codes differ between availability and booking requests. |
| SecondRoomAdults      | Integer       | [1-5] 1 char | N | The number of adults occupying the second room. |
| SecondRoomChildren    | Integer       | [0-4] 1 char | N | The number of children occupying the second room. |

## UK Hotels with parking

The additional parameters for hotel with parking (where parking > 0 days) are:

| Name        | Data Type    | Format | Mandatory? |
| ----        | ----    | --------- | -------- |
| CarDropoffDate        | Date   | YYYY-MM-DD    | Y  |
| CarDropoffTime        | Time   | HHMM    | Y  |
| CarPickupDate         | Date   | YYYY-MM-DD | Y  |
| CarPickupTime         | Time   | HHMM    | Y  |
| ReturnFlight          | String | [0-9A-Z] 10 chars | N |
| TerminalCode          | String | [0-9A-Z] 3 chars  | N |
| Registration          | String | [0-9A-Z] 10 chars | N |
| CarMake               | String | [0-9A-Z] 15 chars | N |
| CarModel              | String | [0-9A-Z] 15 chars | N |
| CarColour             | String | [A-Z] 15 chars    | N |

## Payment

In the UK, we are PCI DSS compliant and so we do not accept customers' payment details being passed to us via the API. Further details can be found in our section on [Payment](/hxapi/payment).

Please contact your Account Manager if you have any questions concerning payment.

## Booking Terms and Conditions

It is important that the customer has access to the Terms and Conditions at the time of placing their booking and after. We highly recommend that these are made clear to the customer _before_ booking.

For European products, please use the following link:

```
http://www.holidayextras.de/images/de-hx/pdf/agb.pdf
```

If you require translations of Terms and Conditions into other languages, you can simply change ``/de-hx/`` (German) into ``nl-hx`` (Dutch), ``it-hex`` (Italian), ``pt-hx`` (Portuguese), ``fr-hx`` (French), ``es-hx`` (Spanish) or ``en-hx`` (English).
