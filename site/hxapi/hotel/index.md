# Important Notices

## Merging product library data into availability response

You can specify a comma-separated list of fields to pull back from the product library. This overcomes the need for partners to do multiple HTTP requests, one for every hotel returned. Just specify a parameter named 'fields' and include the product library field names there.
```
eg...&fields=field_a,field_b,field_c
```

The method for querying the product library as a separate request [is outlined here](/hxapi/productlibrary/parking)

## Advance purchase

There is a field in the product library for hotels, named noncancellable_nonrefundable. Advance purchase products are non-refundable and non-cancellable. As a result, the Cancellation Waiver must not be sold to customers purchasing a product with advance_purchase set to 1.

## Day Use Only

There is a field in the product library for hotels, named 'day_use_only'. Day use products must not be sold to customers wishing to have an overnight stay where day_use_only is set to 1.


## Parking Includes Arrival

In order to establish whether the package includes parking for the night of the hotel stay the parking_includes_arrival field needs to be taken into account.

`<parking_includes_arrival>0</parking_includes_arrival>` - This indicates  whether the parking period starts on the arrival date at the hotel or the next day when the customer is flying.

So 0 means that the night of your stay is not counted, so there is free overnight parking, and the amount of days parking will be from the next day

So 1 means that the parking starts from the date the customer checks into the hotel, and the amount of days parking will start from that day.


## Mystery / Un-named Products

There are some hotels in which the name field will not provide the name of the hotel e.g <Name>Mystery 4-star hotel</Name>.  This should not be provided to the customer until the booking is made, along with other details such as address, hotel images, restaurant names etc.


## European Products

Pass in System=ABG to access products in Europe.

Default if System is not set should be System=ABC to access products in UK only.

You will need to create a voucher for the customer yourself by using the following information from the product library, plus the information from the booking response:

Relevant keys from the php API are (besides the booking specifics like date, name of the hotel, name of the customer...)


*  name

*  adresse

*  GPS coordinates (latitude, longitude)

*  telefon

*  anfahrt (how to get to the hotel)

*  transfer

*  zimmerausstattung (room facilities)
