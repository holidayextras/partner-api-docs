### Request flags

When you receive the availability response, it will indicate which request flags are required to be sent as part of the booking request.

The request flags differ depending on the product's region and the supplier's requirements. A summary is below, but please see the relevant sections in the [availability endpoint documentation](/hxapi/parking/av/airport).

#### UK Products

The `<RequestFlags>` field dictates which fields need to be sent as part of the booking request.

#### European Products

The availability response will return a list of 18 flags in the `<CarDetFlags>` field with a yes/no response to indicate if required. The order of the flags is always the same.

### Payment

In the UK, we are PCI DSS compliant and so we do not accept customers' payment details being passed to us via the API. Further details can be found in our section on [Payment](/hxapi/payment).

Please contact your Account Manager if you have any questions concerning payment.

### Booking Terms and Conditions

It is important that the customer has access to the Terms and Conditions at the time of placing their booking and after. We highly recommend that these are made clear to the customer _before_ booking.

For European products, please use the following link:
```
http://www.holidayextras.de/images/de-hx/pdf/agb.pdf
```

If you require translations of Terms and Conditions into other languages, you can simply change ``/de-hx/`` (German) into ``nl-hx`` (Dutch), ``it-hex`` (Italian), ``pt-hx`` (Portuguese), ``fr-hx`` (French), ``es-hx`` (Spanish) or ``en-hx`` (English).

## Booking Confirmation

We expect partners to create their own booking confirmations to send to customers, using the information provided in the booking response.

However, we also have capability to send booking confirmation emails ourselves on behalf of partners. This feature is not available as standard, and so if you wish to enable this please speak to your Account Manager.
