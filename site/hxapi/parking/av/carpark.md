| CarPark/Filter                    | We have a filter mechanism on our site, to show particular types of product, such as Meet and Greet. The filters that apply to a product are returned here. Possible values are: `meet_and_greet`, `recommended`, `on_airport`, `terminal`, `valet_included`, `car_parked_for_you`.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |
| Pricing/CreditCardSurcharge       | NB: This is only relevant for Intermediary Agents in Europe, where Holiday Extras is responsible for processing the payment, not the Agent. <br>The first step in the calculation is to determine the credit card surcharge payable (x), based on the value of the booking, using this formula: <br>x = (TotalPrice + the CanxWaiver) / 100 x CCardSurchargePercent <br>Second, to prevent the surcharge from exceeding certain boundaries we have min and max thresholds, which can be calculated as follows: <br>if x < CCardSurchargeMin; <br>x = CCardSurchargeMin <br>else if x > CCardSurchargeMax; <br>x = CCardSurchargeMax |
| Pricing/CancellationWaiver/Waiver | We provide an optional cancellation waiver. If this is not added then cancellation will incur a fee. This returns the cancellation fee cost.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |

#### CarDetFlags (Europe Only)

For European products only, the availability response will return a field called `<CarDetFlags>`, which identifies the fields required when making a booking. (This is instead of the `<RequestFlags>` field which is returned for UK products only).

For example: `<CarDetFlags>` NNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNN `</CarDetFlags>`

 The order of the flags is always the same, and refers to these parameters respectively:

  | Position | Parameter | Data Type | Format | Additional Information                            |
  | -------- | -------------- | ---------------- | -----------                                                                        |

  | 6        | CarDropoffTime | Time | HHMM             | Arrival time when you drop the vehicle off at the car park e.g 1000. |
  | 7        | CarPickupTime  | Time | HHMM             | Return time, when you pick the vehicle up from the car park, e.g. 1600. |

  | 10       | InFltNo        | String | [A-Z0-9] 10 chars      | Return flight number e.g. EZY124. |
  | 11       | OutFltTime     | Time | HHMM             | Departure time of the outbound flight e.g. 1200. |
  | 12       | InFltTime      | Time | HHMM             | Arrival time of the inbound flight e.g. 1500. |
