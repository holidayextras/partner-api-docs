# Payment

For all UK partners and any new partners integrating after **1st July 2017**, Holiday Extras will not accept payment details being passed through the API. The responsibility for collecting and processing payment from the customer is the responsibility of the partner.

If you have any questions concerning this then please contact your Account Manager.

## Existing integrations

For existing integrations *in Europe only* we will continue to support the following payment methods via the API:
