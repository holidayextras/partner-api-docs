### Payment

In the UK, we are PCI DSS compliant and so we do not accept customers' payment details being passed to us via the API. Further details can be found in our section on [Payment](/hxapi/payment).

Please contact your Account Manager if you have any questions concerning payment.


## Lounge Booking Response

The lounge booking response will confirm that a booking has been placed in our system.

For a detailed explanation of the fields returned, please see below:

| Field                | Additional Information |
| ----                 | ---------------------- |
| Booking/BookingRef  | This is the reference for this booking. It must be referred to in all communication with us concerning this booking. <br>NB: Our booking references are up to 12 char alphanumeric (including 1/I and 0/O/Q).|

## Booking Confirmation

We expect partners to create their own booking confirmations to send to customers, using the information provided in the booking response.

However, we also have capability to send booking confirmation emails ourselves on behalf of partners. This feature is not available as standard, and so if you wish to enable this please speak to your Account Manager.
