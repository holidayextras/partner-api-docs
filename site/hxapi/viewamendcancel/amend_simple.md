# Amend Booking - simple (no reprice)

[API Docs](/hxapi/) > product:[amend](/hxapi/viewamendcancel/amend_simple)

The booking details that can be changed for a simple amend are as follows:

- Lead passenger name;
- Email address;
- In the case of parking or hotel plus parking bookings, car registration (and other car details);
- Flight numbers (if you are updating multiple flight numbers then you may prefer to use the [Flight Update](/hxapi/flightUpdate) method instead (which permits batch updates).


## Amend Booking Request

We recommend using the [view booking](/hxapi/viewamendcancel/view) method first, to ensure that you have all the details required from the most up to date record of the booking.

### Method

POST

### Endpoint

The endpoint to use is (where `YourBookingRef` is the Holiday Extras booking reference):

```
https://api.holidayextras.com/v1/booking/YourBookingRef
```

### Request Parameters

NB: All parameter names are case sensitive.

For all amend booking requests, you will need to send these parameters:

| Name        | Data Type    | Format | Mandatory? | Additional Information |
| ----        | ----    | --------- | -------- | ---------------------- |
| ABTANumber  | String  | [A-Z0-9] 5 chars | Y | This is also known as an 'agent code'. <br>This will be confirmed to you by your Account Manager during set up.|
| Password    | String  | [A-Z0-9] 5 chars | N*       | Password required for retail agent requests - intermediaries do not require a password.<br>This will be confirmed to you by your Account Manager during set up.|
| Initials    | String  | [A-Z] 3 chars | N  | The initials of the Operator / Agent. |
| key         | String  | [A-Z]                                  | Y        | This will be assigned to you by your Account Manager during set up.|

In order to amend the booking with the new details, you only need to pass in the specific parameters you want to amend. For a simple amend these are as follows:
