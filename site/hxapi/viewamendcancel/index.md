## Manage A Booking Top Tips

The three methods provided will enable your customers via your integration to manage their own booking online.

### Amending a booking

We allow both simple and complex amends:

- A ***simple amend*** is where the booking details are updated, without affecting the price. This is also known as an "amend no re-price". For example, adding a car registration number to a parking booking.
- A ***complex amend*** is where the booking details are updated and this does affect the price. This is also known as an "amend re-price". For example, changing the date of a booking.
