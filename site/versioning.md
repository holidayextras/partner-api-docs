# Versioning

As a guide, we will update the version of the API docs according to the size and impact of the change:

__Minor releases:__
e.g. documentation updates or changes to API not requiring Partner changes.

__Major releases__
e.g. addition of new products and functionality or significant changes to structure of API requiring Partner changes.

We reserve the right to remove outdated and unused functionality, and make changes that may result in deprecation of existing methods. Where this occurs, we will contact you via your Account Manager to advise. Older methods of using the API will be supported for a period of time whilst updates are made by our partners.
