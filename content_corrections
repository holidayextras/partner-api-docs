#Car Hire

- On the `Availability` page: The example request has incorrect date formats for `From` and `To`. eg: `06NOV16` should be `2016-10-06`
- On the `Make Booking` page: The example endpoint states that it needs to be a `GET` request. This should instead be `POST`. We also do not state that requests need to be made using `x-www-form-urlencoded`.
- Test bookings do not need to be notified / cancelled as they are done automatically in Flexible's system (using credentials FCH01HE)
- Test bookings made in live environment & customer bookings need to be cancelled by calling our call centre on

#Parking
- Registration plates are a string, we do not validate this in the API, a partner would need to validate the input if they so wished. (For our direct customers we have the car reg look up but as there is a cost attached to this per look up we have no plans to make this available outside of HX use).

#Product Library
- Would be helpful if a full table of the info returned from product library, along with expected input format, e.g. integer, string, so partners do know what type of output to expect (currently says output should be 'self explanatory' in what it is).

#General

- Not clear that partners have to create their own booking confirmations (on screen or via email) - and to do that they need to use the view booking request.
